# Stock Price Prediction

## AIM

To develop a Recurrent Neural Network model for stock price prediction.

## Problem Statement and Dataset


## Design Steps
### Step 1:
Prepare training data by scaling and creating sequences.
### Step 2:
Add SimpleRNN and Dense layers after initializing a sequential model.
### Step 3:
Use the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss to compile the model.
### Step 4:
Use the ready-made training data to train the model.
### Step 5:
Use the trained model to make predictions, preprocess test data, and display the outcomes.
